  <h2>Markelo Cares</h2>
  <p>
    Our flagship initiative, Markelo Cares, focuses on providing support to
    local communities in the areas of education, health, and environment.
    Through this program, we have funded scholarships, donated to local
    hospitals, and organized tree planting events.

    Markelo encourages employees to contribute their time and skills to
    meaningful causes. We offer paid volunteer days for our employees, allowing
    them to engage with local non-profit organizations and make a difference in
    their communities.

  <h2>Partnerships</h2>

    We actively collaborate with various non-profit organizations and charities
    to create a positive impact on a larger scale. Our partnerships have helped
    us drive meaningful change in areas such as disaster relief, child welfare,
    and wildlife conservation.
